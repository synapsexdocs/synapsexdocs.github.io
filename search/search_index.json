Earlier today, a public deobfuscator was released for the Luraph obfuscator commonly used by S^X scripts. This is mostly an announcement on how we will change how script obfuscation works with S^X going forward: Xen is now discontinued (in its current form). We don't believe Xen is secure anymore after this release and should not be relied on to protect your scripts. Do note we (currently) believe Ironbrew and its variants are likely 'good enough' as of right now. We recommend using one of those instead. I probably work on a new version of Xen sometime later. We are working on ways of opening up our internal script obfuscation infrastructure to you guys - more announcements coming soon. I will likely start working on a new version of Xen now 2.1.6b (b3) Fixed issue with legacy UI exceptions. SX 2.1.6b (b2) Much needed UI bugbash! Improved UI loading speed - it should be significantly faster to open SX now. Fixed internal UI not opening on multiple instances with AutoLaunch enabled. Fixed UI crashing if there is an injection error. (took long enough) Hopefully fixed gray screens w/ new UI - should alert users that they need to install VS redistributable now. SX 2.1.6b Fixed getspecialinfo/saveinstance 2.1.6 Updated. 2.1.5c We told you guys we would keep you updated on the banwave that happened a few days ago, here it is. This update should fix the issue that caused the 6.25% of users that were affected last time. Of course, nothing can be for certain, this included. We recommend you to keep using the same precautionsuntil the next banwave (whenever that will be) If you do not know already, the \"precautions\" are incredibly simple: Enable AutoLaunch (AutoAttach is NOT AutoLaunch) Make a new account on a VPN w/ a fresh browser instance (does NOT matter which one you use, just make sure its a system wide one) I personally recommend Firefox containers for a fresh browser instance. Just make sure you make a new container specifically for that new account. Whenever you play, join with a VPN (you don't need to use the same location as you signed up with, just make sure you are not on your home IP) Done! Fixed crash with debug.getupvalues Fixed parsing issue with type. 2.1.5b Fixed weird crashes on teleport/exit (sorry bout it taking a while, was a few issues that caused the same thing to happen) 2.1.5 Updated. 2.1.4c argument change to syn.secure_call - instead of passing an environment for the 2nd parameter, pass a LocalScript instead. (you can likely keep using the same as before, just dont getsenv() it) added \"support\" for lua type info - it will just be treated as whitespace and ignored, but you can use it Example: local KeyHandler = require ( game : GetService ( \"ReplicatedStorage\" ). Assets . Modules . KeyHandler ) local PlayerName = game : GetService ( \"Players\" ). LocalPlayer . Name local FakeEnv = game : GetService ( \"Workspace\" ). Live [ PlayerName ]. CharacterHandler . Input local Result = syn . secure_call ( KeyHandler , FakeEnv ) local Event = syn . secure_call ( Result . getKey , FakeEnv , \"ApplyFallDamage\" , \"plum\" ) --do whatever 2.1.4b Should of fixed scripts crashing w/ new update, report in DMs if any still are broken (but worked in 2.1.3) Fixed firetouchinterest. isluau now returns a constant true - you should just remove calls to this in your scripts, non-luau is never coming back debug.*locals will be completely removed in a few weeks, not just error 2.1.4 Updated. A lot of things changed this update - report broken scripts! We did a lot of testing before this update, but we want to make sure everything 100% works. 2.1.3 Updated. Fixed __len metamethod not working with SX code. (old af issue, im surprised no one contacted me before about that) Update took longer then usual due to me finding + fixing quite a few bugs that happened due to this update. Please note I only update SX after all issues are fixed. 2.1.2e Added Syn-User-Identifier header to syn.request - this is similar to Syn-Fingerprint, but does not change between PCs. Pretty useful as a way to identify Synapse accounts for cross-PC save data/etc. 2.1.2b Fixed issue with newcclosure crashing with empty errors (thx wally for finding) Fixed getnamecallmethod crashing if one was never set (returns nil in that case now) New script dumper in script hub thanks to turtle 2.1.2 Updated. 2.1.1 Updated. 2.1.0b This is mostly an internal update, but you must restart the UI for this update. Sorry for the inconvenience. This fixes the crashing on injection issue for some AMD processors. HWID algorithm change, Syn-Fingerprint header for requests 2.1.0 -- UI Updates Fixed error spoofing not working with autoattach - no more bans on Strucid! This is the 2nd part of the 2.0 update that we were working on, and we are happy to announce it is ready to release! Brand new, state of the art UI! Added full tabs support, with unsaved edits notifications, etc. New editor (no more monaco) - error detection added, etc. Added prompts for closing files/clearing your editor (these can be turned off in options) Editor has built in support for many predefined themes. Output redirection works with built in console now aswell. Use printconsole to go to the UI. Added support for keybinds - Ctrl + S & Ctrl + O work as expected now w/ editor. Your options will be reset with the new update. Please reconfigure them with the new options menu. PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU FIND - we did private beta testing before this, but we want to make sure you guys have the best experience possible. Have fun! 2.0.2c Fixed crashes w/ getsenv on non-running LocalScripts. 2.0.2 Updated. 2.0.1d Hopefully made Checking whitelist... faster - say in #general if it decreased. 2.0.1c Fixed error spoofing (shouldnt ban on strucid anymore) (use internal UI to get errors) 2.0.1b Fixed getspecialinfo/saveinstance crashes. 2.0.1 Updated. 2.0.0c Fixed debug.setupvalue not working in rare cases. 2.0.0b Fixed debug.*upvalue(s) functions. Should fix the weird crashes that were happening since earlier today. 2.0.0 ITS HERE. Synapse X's long awaited decompiler is now in public beta! Please report issues as bug reports in support. You do not need to enable beta releases for this. Only 64-bit systems are supported as of currently - sorry for the inconvenience. Made whitelist faster in the process - enjoy! 1.10.17b Fixed getspecialinfo. Should also fix saveinstance crashes. 1.10.17 Updated. 1.10.16 Updated. A lot of things changed this update - please report in the support system if there is bugs with scripts/similar that DID NOT OCCUR last update. Thanks! 1.10.15c Hopefully fixed getconnections for good. If any events still crash when calling getconnections, please file a bug report. Thanks. 1.10.15 Updated. Changed non-recoverable constants (ie userdatas or similar) to empty strings (\"\") instead of nil's to prevent certain table functions breaking. Please note that if there are any legitimate nil constants in the function, the nil's will still be there. 1.10.14b Probably fixed something 1.10.14 Updated. Fixed getsenv on ModuleScripts. Made Syn-Fingerprint header public on syn.request. (allows you to get a users HWID) Sorry about the late update - there was a few issues that made it take longer. 1.10.13 Updated. 1.10.12b Fixed error messages being corrupted. 1.10.12 Fixed issues with the previous update (again) Added 'continue' statement - allows you to move on to the next iteration in the for loop without using a temporary variable (this was added to studio so I added it here too) UI Changes (restart the UI to get them): Added continue statement to syntax highlighting. Added more functions into intellisense. Removed ingame chat option (it has been disabled for over 3 months now, forgot to remove it from the UI) Example: -- simple sum = 0 for i = 1 , 10 do if i == 5 then continue end sum = sum + i end print ( sum == 50 ) 1.10.11c Fixed the above issue. (Some breaking change, same thing from previous update) 1.10.11b No changes, this just forces the update I sent above. Enjoy! (Something about being detected in some games (not Roblox itsself), broken signature) 1.10.11 Updated. 1.10.10c Fixed issues with getfenv calls. 1.10.10b More internal changes - it hopefully shouldn't break anything, report if it does. 1.10.10 Updated. Fixed kicks from large amount of HttpGet/HttpPost usage. This update does a lot of internal changes that may break paid/secured scripts - if they do break, please report them to your scripts developer, not us. (as they relied on undocumented/internal features) Added back name field to debug.getinfo (allows you to get local function names for both SX and non-SX functions) Added local function name to SX stack traces. 1.10.9 Updated. 1.10.8d Fixed issue with old processes being stuck in the background after leaving a game - this should fix random S^X crash boxes long times after you exit. 1.10.8c Fixed the kicking/crashing issues - sorry for the inconvenience. 1.10.8 Updated. 1.10.6d Fixed 'Internal error with whitelist' issue with some users. 1.10.6c Did some server updates - sorry about the downtime! You should be able to use S^X now. 1.10.6 Fixed various bugs/issues with injection and similar. We recommend you restart S^X before using this update. It is not required for this update, but we highly recommend it. 1.10.5 This was supposed to be released yesterday but I did not have the time - sorry! Fixed teleport crashing/random errors on teleports. Report if they still happen in #bug-report. Fixed stuck on scanning issues. Attempted to make injection even faster - please report if it got any faster for you in #general. Fixed firetouchinterest (again...) AutoExecute now is before ReplicatedFirst (again) Enjoy the fixes - more coming soon! 1.10.4b Fixed getloadedmodules. Improved speed at the 'injecting...' phase - say if it got any quicker for you in #general. 1.10.4 Updated. 1.10.3 Updated. 1.10.2d Fixed dumpstring. Fixed potential security issue with AutoLaunch that could of affected you if you used S^X from 1.10.2 (Wednesday) until this update was released last night. We suggest changing your alt if you want to be 100% safe. (since it could potentially lead to bans) Note that AutoAttach and regular injection was not affected by this. 1.10.2 Updated. 1.10.1e Crashes should be fixed now. Report any new ones in #bug-report. Sorry for the inconvenience : / 1.10.1c Fixed internal UI crashing. Removed internal explorer - its unstable and not used very much. Dex works just as well now, so just use that. (b was just bug fixes) 1.10.1 This update does some major changes on our backend that don't allow automated updating to this version. Restart S^X to get this version. Getting an error if you don't restart S^X is expected. Just restart S^X if you dont want to get it. Fixed error spoofing. Various other minor fixes. 1.10.0 Updated. Sorry for the really long update, guys. This update was quite hard - and I only got it fully working today. Report any issues in #bug-report. 1.9.9e Fixed random crashes with certain scripts. Also, please take the time to fill out the following form - I got a few reports of people being banned in the past few days and I don't want to take any chances. Thank you! [link redacted] 1.9.9d Updated. Sorry about the late update - this update was pretty hard to due to a lot of things changing. Sorry. 1.9.9c Added functions 'syn.protect_gui' and 'syn.unprotect_gui'. See below for usage. The new syn.protect_gui function protects your GUIs from recursive FindFirstChild-style attacks. After you call the function, recursive FFA calls from non-Synapse contexts will skip over your protected instances & all children of such instances. Example: local GUI = game : GetObjects ( \"whatever\" )[ 1 ] syn . protect_gui ( GUI ) -- Its preferable to call protect_gui before your GUI is parented, but it is not required. GUI . Parent = game : GetService ( \"CoreGui\" ) 1.9.9b Updated. 1.9.9 Added function attributes for namecall/future use - see #beta-releases for details. Fixed compile-time error messages being empty. Released __namecall compatibility to full release - report any issues in #bug-report w/ broken scripts. (make sure to test the attributes first) 1.9.8b internal-changes only, beta release SX 1.9.8 (UI only) Fixed CPU usage issue w/ UI. Fixed crash on exit for some users. 1.9.8 Updated. Sorry about the long update - I had dental work today (not very epic) & didnt have time earlier to complete the update. 1.9.7c Added WebSocket API - see #beta-releases for new documentation. 1.9.6b Fixed .Function/.State/:Fire crashing with certain events. WARNING: .Function/.State can return nil now - please check for nil before using it further! 1.9.6 Fixed connections API: getconnections firesignal .Function .State :Enable :Disable :Fire Fixed firetouchinterest. also connection:Enable/Disable should be more stable then it was before 1.9.5 Updated. 1.9.4 Fixed teleport instability issues. (finally) Improved HWID spoofer in AutoLaunch. (enable from options) Fixed various odd crashes with very specific scripts. Removed ability to execute before ReplicatedFirst. (for now - i'm working on a better impl that shouldnt be horribly unstable) 1.9.3c (Hopefully) fixed D-03 injection issues. 1.9.3b Fixed HttpGet being broken. (aka some scripts not working) 1.9.3 Updated. I am aware about Windows 7 issues, update should be coming soon to fix that. 1.9.2c Fixed yieldfunction instability problems 1.9.2b Fixed wrong offset w/ teleports 1.9.2 Made attaching process more stable overall. IMPORTANT: This update requires a SX restart. Do not be alarmed by 'Outdated UI version', this is just to force you to restart SX. Thank you! (for beta users: please restart the UI as I didn't add that functionality to it) Note for UI devs: This update also has a required sxlib update. Thank you! 1.9.1b Fixed getcallingscript (now stop complaining wally SMH) 1.9.1 Updated. Fixed getsenv breaking with ModuleScripts. Fixed automated conversion w/ numbers in certain functions (ex: setclipboard) setting invalid values. 1.9.0b Added 'syn.queue_on_teleport' (see info in #beta-releases) Fixed crash when making the internal UI windows too small... lol. 1.9.0 Updated. Some much needed love was done to the internal UI - enjoy the fresh new look to it! [TURTLE] whoops im retarded 1.8.0d Removed ingame chat (nobody actually used it + it was a easy detection vector) Temporarily removed the WebSocket API - expect it to be re-added hopefully soon with a better implementation. 1.8.0c Fixed bug that caused debug.getupvalue/debug.setupvalue to crash if the script accidentally provides 0 instead of 1 as the index. Attempted to improve getgc stability (again) Breaking change: getgc by default will now only return functions, in order to return userdatas + tables please pass 'true' as an argument. Example: getgc ( true ) --> Returns both userdatas + tables. 1.8.0b Fixed getgc instability (again) 1.8.0 Updated. Fixed 'getloadedmodules' (this should fix the script dumper) More fixes coming soon:tm: If you were banned today or yesterday, please report it here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNYQ162V_jQPpsTa-xqFvcM8KRLhtOHCP-eGTpIiBVgZi9XA/viewform?usp=sf_link (as usual I wasnt affected but I still want to figure out a root cause for people that were) 1.7.9c Fixed bug with decompiling LinkedSource scripts. Fixed crashing issue with hookfunction. 1.7.9b released (forgot to announce last night) Made injection more stable. (you want to restart Synapse for this update - I edited some part that cannot be autoupdated without restarting) 1.7.9 Fixed kicks after teleporting from certain games. 1.7.8e Fixed very specific scripts causing kicks in LuaU games. (1.7.8d was an internal only update, no user changelogs) 1.7.8 Updated. Make sure to report any bugs/issues in #bug-report. Thanks! (forgot to announce this aswell) Fixed speed issues with 'isluau'. Added error spoofing when Synapse detects .Error attempts. 1.7.7b Fixed environment issues on LuaU games. Fixed debug.*upvalues being 0 based on LuaU games (they should be 1 based like everything else now) General speed improvements on Synapse API functions. 1.7.7 Fixed decompile/other yieldfunctions having instability/crashing problems. Made Synapse take advantage of LuaU optimizations when possible - we can report that this (generally) increased script performance around 20%, and more specialized scripts can be up to 4.5x faster under certain conditions. Enjoy! 1.7.6 Fixed decompiler on non-LuaU games. Fixed getsenv. Fixed internal UI/explorer. Fixed getscripts returning locked scripts. Fixed require breaking. Fixed crashes with debug.*stack. Added 'no upvalue' hookfunction for certian functions that have no upvalues (tick, wait, etc). This will make hooking these functions much more stable. getloadedmodules still seems to be broke even though I wasted an hour trying to fix it. I'll try again later. Yes, I know about getconnnections/similar breaking. Expect a fix hopefully soon when DefCon finishes other projects. 1.7.5b Fixed Synapse for realzys this time. Have fun! :) 1.7.5 Updated. Fixed various LuaU issues (thanks Inori for reporting them) Sorry about the really long update - there was a lot more to update then usual. 1.7.4b Fixed crashes/instability problems with obfuscated scripts on LuaU games. Added 'long jump' support for LuaU games - you can now make functions much bigger (around 256x bigger then they used to be!) Enjoy! 1.7.4 Fixed off by one error with debug.*upvalue functions with numeric indices. Fixed crashes/instability with debug.setupvalue on LuaU enabled games. 1.7.3c Fixed crashes on LuaU games with some scripts. 1.7.3b Fixed debug.getupvalue/debug.setupvalue crashing on LuaU enabled games. Error spoofing has been re-enabled on beta release. See #beta-releases for more information. 1.7.3 Updated. (reinject if you have Internal Error, forgot to push the server update lol) 1.7.2 Added explorer icons for more instances (epic :sunglasses:) Added getnamecallmethod/setnamecallmethod for LuaU games. Developers, please read #beta-releases for details on the new __namecall system. 1.7.1 (BETA) Added early build of explorer - it is quite limited right now, but you are free to test if you wish. You can only edit string, boolean, and numeric properties right now, but more likely will be coming soon. Reparenting/etc will likely also be coming soon. Report crashes/issues with the explorer in #beta-bugs-and-features. Fixed slowdown/FPS drops on LuaU enabled games. 1.7.0b Added function isluau - does what you expect. sxlib update This has a few breaking changes. See below. Added the inline auto-update system to sxlib - this is auto done with SxLib.Attach(). Added a few events into attaching for this: NOT_RUNNING_LATEST_VER -> NOT_RUNNING_LATEST_VER_UPDATING: This is the new event to say an autoupdate is happening. UPDATING_DLLS: Obvious. NOT_UPDATED: This is if Synapse X detects an autoupdate but is not marked as updated yet (this usually will happen if Synapse is not updated yet, its the same as the load event) FAILED_TO_UPDATE: If an error happens during auto-updating. Tell the user to restart their UI. REINJECTING: This event will be fired when the update completes, and Synapse X can now re-inject. Note that a new parameter will be passed also - the new Synapse version. This changes the event signatures for Attach and Load to contain another parameter, as some events now send other useful info along with them LoadEvent.READY now passes the Synapse X version in the other parameter. AttachEvent.REINJECTING now passes the new Synapse X version in the other parameter. 1.7.0 Added LuaU execution to release. Enjoy! This is the first update to use the new non-relaunching auto-update system - tell in #general if it worked for you. 1.6.8 Updated. LuaU might be enabled on quite a few games soon, so save any games you wish to make scripts for now. Once its enabled LuaU execution will be pushed to release. 1.6.7 (UI) This UI update adds a new (and quite convenient) feature - you do not need to relaunch Synapse in order to update anymore! Only currently supported on non-beta UI, will do a beta UI update probably tommorow. Of course, you still have to relaunch the UI in order to get this new feature - lol. 1.6.7 Removed setnonreplicatedproperty - it had no use and would break constantly anyway. See #beta-releases for some epic new info. 1.6.6e Fixed beta release breaking (0iq me) 1.6.6d Fixed getspecialinfo (this should fix saveinstance crashes) Fixed formatting on print/warn. 1.6.6c Speed improvements. For the newbies here: to update Synapse X, all you have to do is restart the Synapse X app. The rest is done automatically for you. 1.6.6b Fixed 'Script Dumper' crashing. Fixed 'getloadedmodules'. 1.6.6 Updated. 1.6.5e Fixed debug.getupvalue. Added argument to getgc - allows you to return tables. Use getgc(true) to get tables within the GC list. Please note that this might cause instability as table GC'ing is quite weird and does not like being deref'd in a random script. I know firetouchintrest is broke, I don't really know how to fix it (DefCon made it and I'm waiting for him to respond on how to update it) - should hopefully be fixed when he comes online. Thanks! 1.6.5d Patched stupid detection methods (nice try, though) 1.6.5c Add timeout parameter to the decompiler, example below. Timeout is measured in seconds. Saveinstance uses a default timeout of 30 seconds now. You can overwrite this with the timeout table param, same as noscripts. Example: print ( decompile ( game . Workspace . whateverlocalscript , \"new\" , 15 )) -- If this times out (over 15 seconds), it will return a \"Decompiler timeout\" string. 1.6.5b Fixed crashing on inject issues for certain users with unicode usernames (again) Internal improvements. [TURTLE]: Looks like I missed another two weeks, sorry! 1.6.0 Hopefully improved injection and teleport stability by a lot. Hopefully we won't get 3+ crashes a minute now :^) Autoexec will now always execute before ReplicatedFirst if you attach before the game loads. Revamped the entire cryptographic APIs: syn.crypt.encrypt/syn.crypt.decrypt: Switched algorithm. Old encrypted text wont work anymore. syn.crypt.hash: Switched algorithm to SHA-384. syn.crypt.random: Added function to get secure random bytes. Use syn.crypt.random(x) to get a string with x cryptographically random bytes. syn.crypt.derive: Derives x bytes from password. Use syn.crypt.derive(\"password\", x) to get a string with x bytes from the password. You should use this to get a key for the custom methods. New 'custom' APIs added: syn.crypt.custom.encrypt/syn.crypt.custom.decrypt: This now allows you to specify a range of algorithms to encrypt/decrypt your text with. Supported algorithms: aes-cbc aes-cfb aes-ctr aes-ofb aes-gcm (recommended) aes-eax blowfish-cbc blowfish-cfb blowfish-ofb You must specify a valid key and IV. Example: local enc = syn . crypt . custom . encrypt ( \"aes-gcm\" , \"hi gamers!\" , \"$nLliCMdi7gcynsFCK9u0aVNdtkNIiZG\" , \"Agd13KuKIL2$\" ) print ( enc ) print ( syn . crypt . custom . decrypt ( \"aes-gcm\" , enc , \"$nLliCMdi7gcynsFCK9u0aVNdtkNIiZG\" , \"Agd13KuKIL2$\" )) --\"hi gamers\" syn.crypt.custom.hash: This now allows you to specify a range of algorithms to hash your text with. Supported algorithms: md5 sha1 sha224 sha256 sha384 sha512 sha3-256 sha3-384 sha3-512 Example: print ( syn . crypt . custom . hash ( \"sha224\" , \"based\" )) --\"86aedf48256d409d6ff1766a95f0263a5dfc0f7d1db36635d20a44d3\" Added syn.request - This function is the same as HttpService:RequestAsync, but with a few extra features: You can specify a User-Agent. Cookies table added, works as you expect. Async just like the original function. Example: local response = syn . request ( { Url = \"http://httpbin.org/post\" , -- This website helps debug HTTP requests Method = \"POST\" , Headers = { [ \"Content-Type\" ] = \"application/json\" -- When sending JSON, set this! }, Body = game : GetService ( \"HttpService\" ): JSONEncode ({ hello = \"world\" }) } ) for i , v in pairs ( response ) do print ( i , v ) if type ( v ) == \"table\" then for i2 , v2 in pairs ( v ) do warn ( i2 , v2 ) end end end 1.5.5 Updated. 1.5.4 New, much faster whitelist. Injection times should now be (at least) 4x less. Report how much faster it is for you in #general. 1.5.3c (Attempted) stability fixes. Report if crashes reduce with this update. (if not say so in #crash-report) 1.5.3b (b2) Fixed stuck on \"Checking...\" issues. Fixed some users needing to launch Synapse as admin. Fixed autolaunch breaking for those same users. 1.5.3b Fixed various crashes with firetouchinterest. Added proper error handling to firetouchinterest (lol) Added definition for firetouchinterest in editor. 1.5.3 Updated. Added firetouchinterest . Fixed is_synapse_function breaking with Synapse CClosures (again) 1.5.2b Fixed crash on inject for some users. Make sure to restart the Synapse X application for this update. 1.5.2 Added script hub to internal UI (see pic below) Fixed autoexec scripts not running when teleporting with only the internal UI open Fixed autoattach checkbox being attached to the autolaunch checkbox (lol) If you get double autoexec when using the launcher, restart Synapse, I did a patch to fix this in autolaunch. 1.5.1 (b3) Fixed crash with getloadedmodules. Fixed getsenv with LocalScripts not working. Make sure to restart the Synapse X application for this update. 1.5.1 (b2) Fixed crash on inject for Windows 7 systems. Make sure to restart the Synapse X application in order to get this update. 1.5.1 Updated. Sorry about the late update, more stuff was changed then usual. I might of messed a function or two up, please report that in #bug-report if that is the case. 1.5.0c (b2) This update mostly does backend security changes - if you have any problems with logging in, please contact me. 1.5.0c Added reset scale button to UI (I know a lot of people wanted this, enjoy) Extended ban protection now supports ALL systems when using AutoLaunch. Fixed loadstring null byte issue. Hopefully made AutoLaunch more stable. Please note what I said earlier: HWID spoofing ONLY works with AutoLaunch. You do not get this protection otherwise. 1.5.0b (b4) Added scaling to the new UI! Think the new UI is too big or too small? Don't worry, you can change that now. 1.5.0b (b3) Eliminated the root cause for the CPU usage spikes - should be normal now. :) 1.5.0b (b2) This update should hopefully decrease CPU usage. Also made teleports a lot more stable (messed up how teleport handler works - 200 iq) [TURTLE]: super sorry about missing a whole month of updates, never asked for a discord invite 1.4.0 Updated. Improved launch/injection speeds. Improved decompiler. Improved 'getgc' function to not crash as much. Improved Drawing API stability. Lots of other internal changes this update, make sure to report bugs/crashes in #bug-report/#crash-report respectively. Added functions: getconnectionstate, getinstancefromstate, getconnectionfunc, getstates, firesignal. Our new developers for Synapse X (DefCon and Eternal) played a large part in this update, which we have been working on for the past week. Enjoy! 1.3.6 Updated. - ;) 1.3.5 (b2) Removed light theme (seems the studies were wrong, how sad :( - april fools btw) Added editor object to the theme API w/ properties below. Light - Allows you to enable light mode editor. FixPixel - The pixel at the top left of the UI to prevent flickering. You can set that to any color now. Theme version is now 5. Your theme should auto update, but keep a backup before relaunching Synapse to make sure. See Theme API docs for more info: https://github.com/LoukaMB/SynapseX/wiki/Theme-API For people that still want the light theme (ew), heres a theme file for it. 1.3.5 This update adds something a lot of people have been waiting for a - a new decompiler! It currently defeats practically every anti-decompilation technique I have tried on it so far. The arguments for decompile have changed, see below. And no, this isnt a april fools joke. That will be tommorow. Usage: decompile ( x ) --this will use the old decompiler decompiler ( x , true ) --this will get the bytecode of the script (deprecated) decompile ( x , \"legacy\" ) --this is the preferred way of using the old decompiler. decompile ( x , \"dump\" ) --gets the bytecode (same as true, but not deprecated) decompile ( x , \"new\" ) --this uses the NEW decompiler to get the script. note it might be slower. 1.3.4b Fixed various detection methods for Synapse. (this isnt really a significant update, no ping for this) 1.3.4 Updated. Whitelist speed improvements. This update does a lot of internal changes, make sure to report crashes/bugs in #crash-report/#bug-report. 1.3.3d This should (hopefully) fix crash on injection issues casued by 1.3.3c. Please make sure to report all crashes/bugs in #bug-report/#crash-report! Added back Herobrine - o.o 1.3.3c Fixed more crash on injection issues. Improved injection speeds for various users. 1.3.3b Removed Herobrine. Fixed (most) crashing at injection issues. Please make sure to report crashes/other bugs in #crash-report and #bug-report. Thanks! 1.3.3 Updated. 1.3.2 Updated. Fixed crashing at startup for select PCs. Minor improvements to the internal UI (added ability to disable autoscroll) 1.3.1 Updated. Fixed FPS unlocker having to be enabled to use internal UI. Fixed internal UI initial sizes being broken. Fixed bug where minimizing one window would make others disappear. Fixed rare whitelist bug on certain AMD processors which would break the whitelist. Fixed bug where the editor would not save that you had no text. 1.3.0 Added internal UI in options - this allows you to use a ingame GUI. Press your INSERT key to toggle it once enabled. Your Synapse editor now saves when you exit Synapse X - tab support is still under development. Added function 'printconsole'. (prints to the internal UI's console) Your options have been reset this update, please re-enable them in the options menu. 1.3.0b Fixed crashes on injection. https://i.donaldjtrump.io/vcomkxtp.png 1.2.7 This should hopefully fix all of the whitelist issues with the 1.2.6 builds of Synapse. Enjoy! 1.2.6b This update just forcefully pushes the changes from last night (see last message) to all clients who haven't done so already. 1.2.6 Updated. Security upgrades - we changed how whitelisting works, you should automatically rewhitelist but if you get a 24 hour error say in #support. 1.2.5b Fixed anti-decompilation method abusing LinkedSource. Fixed Outline property in Drawing API (took long enough) Added OutlineColor property in Drawing API (allows you to set the outline color instead of just black) Fixed DevConsole detection issues. 1.2.5 Updated. 1.2.4 Updated. 1.2.3d This is another bugfix update - please report crashes in #crash-report! This should also (hopefully) eliminate actual Roblox crashes - all crashes should be from Synapse's internal crash handler now. (this means all crashes can be reported now) 1.2.3c This update mostly just fixes misc. bugs that were reported in #crash-report - make sure to post recent crash reports there so I can fix them! 1.2.3b Fixed saveinstance. Fixed various crashing on injection issues (make sure to keep reporting them in #crash-report, they help a lot!) Fixed decompiling bytecode hashing bug (enjoy, wally) 1.2.3 Updated. 1.2.2b Fixed crash with FPS unlocker on injection. 1.2.2 Added function saveinstance - this one you guys have been waiting a while for. As of now, it fully supports saving unions, meshparts, terrain, etc. Thanks Reru for the script used in this. Added supporting function getspecialinfo - this allows you to get the info of MeshParts, UnionOperations, and Terrain. Note: Unlike Visneya, Synapse X's getspecialinfo also supports getting the terrain fields. ( SmoothGrid and MaterialColors ) Added functions syn.crypto.base64.encode/syn.crypto.base64.decode - this is used in saveinstance for performance reasons, and is MUCH faster then any Lua implementation. Updated FPS unlocker to latest build. Supported fields: MeshParts: PhysicsData InitialSize UnionOperations: AssetId ChildData FormFactor InitialSize MeshData PhysicsData Terrain: SmoothGrid MaterialColors If you would like any more properties, ask me in DMs. 1.2.1 Updated. 1.2.0 Hopefully fixed detections (for good this time) - it took a very long time for me to make a full fix for this, as my bypass broke a few things in Synapse that were difficult to fix. Fixed misspelling in a few functions (u can now shut wally) Fixed that stupid \"Synapse X \" text going to all the way to the left issue - took long enough. is_synapse_function supports newcclosure'd functions now. I got bored of the 1.1.X version scheme, moved up to 1.2.0. 1.1.9c Bypassed \"banwave\" update. 1.1.9b Added a crash reporting system that should make reporting Synapse crashes to me easier. 1.1.9 Updated. 1.1.8 Fixed detection method for Synapse X (thanks to Magik Manz for finding this) 1.1.7d Fixed custom WebSocket API breaking on teleports. 1.1.7c Released custom WebSocket API, this allows you to use WebSockets within Synapse X scripts. See the documentation at https://github.com/LoukaMB/SynapseX/wiki/WebSocket-API for more information. 1.1.7b (UI update) Released the new Synapse X WebSocket API - check the documentation here: https://github.com/LoukaMB/SynapseX/wiki/WebSocket-API This should allow a lot of customization for Synapse X (including new UIs/plugins for VS code/etc) For theme developers, Version was incremented to 4 to accommodate this change. See the new WebSocket settings in theme.json for more details. Your theme should auto upgrade. 1.1.7b Made game:HttpGetAsync/game:HttpPostAsync actually async again. You won't freeze when you use these functions anymore. 1.1.7 Updated. Some news that I forgot to mention before: I completed the auto-updater! This should significantly reduce update times. (I used to have update everything manually, this automates ~95% of the update process.) I released Xen 1.1.1, it improves on Xen 1.1.0 and makes it more secure. This was released a day ago, but has a quite few new features to protect against new users trying to RE your scripts (you can use !obfuscate) for it More announcements coming soon on some other projects I am working on. 1.1.6 Updated. Fixed drawing objects not being cleared on teleport. Unfortunately, the new feature I was planning to release this update was not stable enough to be released. Expect an update later on this week when its completed. 1.1.5 Added getconnections - this is a feature a lot of people have been asking me for. Documentation is in UI, example is below. Fixed some script hub scripts crashing on people running Windows 7. Fixed extended setlist instructions not being correctly converted. 1.1.4 Finally fixed D3DCompiler issues for new users of Synapse X. Fixed random crashes after long periods of using Synapse X. Made updating Synapse X take a lot easier for me now. Fixed script hub desync when using the arrow keys on the script list. Added functions iscallerscript , syn.crypt.encrypt , syn.crypt.decrypt , syn.crypt.hash , and setnonreplicatedproperty . Documentation is in UI now. Injecting may take longer now. Future updates will improve this - not much I can do. I will give more details on why in a little. 1.1.3 (b2) Fixed stuck on Ready to launch! issues for select users. 1.1.3 Updated for Roblox update. Documented a few more functions that I forgot to document in intellisense. Fixed Synapse getting stuck if you quit Roblox before injecting completes. General bug bashing update, lots of misc. bugs fixed that aren't worth talking about. 1.1.2b Fixed init script errors ( getrawmetatable is nil or whatever) 1.1.2 Updated for Roblox update. Added Options button, see new features below for that. Added FPS unlocker (in options menu) Added auto-attach (in options menu) Fixed autoexec scripts not executing when teleported to another game. Fixed exceptions when spamming the attach button. For theme developers: new \"OptionsButton\" added to \"Main\" UI, version also incremented to 3. Your theme will autoupgrade, but you might need to adjust your theme for the new button. 1.1.1c [Reverted the same day] Really fixed game:HttpGetAsync/game:HttpPostAsync this time around. No more freezing on doing HttpGet/HttpPost! 1.1.1b Updated for Roblox update. Improved stability at injection time. (I have experienced no crashes during testing this with this new update, it should be a lot better now. report any crashes in #general) Attempted fix for environment overwrite issues at injection time, this should fix detections on Island Royale (but I havent tested it 100%, report issues) 1.1.1 Added getloadedmodules to Synapse. Intellisense now documents all new functions. Significantly reduced authentication times. Say if it decreased for you in #general. 1.1.0c Added debug.getinfo function (people complained that they wanted it, here you go) Added isrbxactive function (the key/mouse functions check this now, so you cant keypress outside of the Roblox window) 1.1.0b Updated for Roblox update. Fixed Script Hub size not being locked (thanks wally!) 1.1.0 Added Drawing/D3D API to Synapse X. Compatible with Proto's API, a Synape-oriented API should be coming soonTM. Added back script hub to Synapse X. (not many scripts yet, i'll add some as times goes on.) Added back theme support to Synapse X. You can customize it via bin/theme.json. Added dumpstring , allows conversion to Roblox bytecode from a source string. Further protection against tainted checks. Should be close to impossible for it to happen now. Fixed crashes on exiting the Synapse UI. Fixed being able to decompile Synapse functions (hi wally) Fixed loadstring not supporting Roblox bytecode. 1.0.0d Updated for Roblox update. Added back getgc and is_synapse_function. Roblox (sorta) removed HttpGet/HttpPost this update, I reimplemented it for the time being. Please note that this reimplementation is not async right now, but will be hopefully with a patch tommorow. 1.0.0c Fixed stuck on checking whitelist issues for some users Incremented version counter for tainted bypass 1.0.0b Updated for Roblox update Fixed require being broken Added more security to wl changes Fixed UI not exiting sometimes when clicking the exit button Fixed stuck on \"Joining Discord...\" 1.0.0 No changelogs for the official first release","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"credits/","text":"noobmaster - Making the docs Burkino - Recording the synapse changelog Turtle - Recording the synapse changelog Ceg - \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af danisty\u00a7 - Mental support","title":"Credits"},{"location":"custom-lua-functions/console-functions/","text":"Console Print < void > rconsoleprint (< string > message ) Prints message into the console. rconsoleprint also supports colors.
