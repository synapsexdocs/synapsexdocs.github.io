If any events still crash when calling getconnections, please file a bug report. Thanks. 1.10.15 [*] Updated. [*] Changed non-recoverable constants (ie userdatas or similar) to empty strings (\"\") instead of nil's to prevent certain table functions breaking. Please note that if there are any legitimate nil constants in the function, the nil's will still be there. 1.10.14b [*] Probably fixed something 1.10.14 [*] Updated. [*] Fixed getsenv on ModuleScripts. [*] Made Syn-Fingerprint header public on syn.request. (allows you to get a users HWID) [!] Sorry about the late update - there was a few issues that made it take longer. 1.10.13 [*] Updated. 1.10.12b [*] Fixed error messages being corrupted. 1.10.12 [*] Fixed issues with the previous update (again) [+] Added 'continue' statement - allows you to move on to the next iteration in the for loop without using a temporary variable (this was added to studio so I added it here too) [*] UI Changes (restart the UI to get them): [+] Added continue statement to syntax highlighting. [*] Added more functions into intellisense. [-] Removed ingame chat option (it has been disabled for over 3 months now, forgot to remove it from the UI) example: -- simple sum = 0 for i = 1 , 10 do if i == 5 then continue end sum = sum + i end print ( sum == 50 ) 1.10.11c [*] Fixed the above issue. (Some breaking change, same thing from previous update) 1.10.11b [*] No changes, this just forces the update I sent above. Enjoy! (Something about being detected in some games (not Roblox itsself), broken signature) 1.10.11 [*] Updated. 1.10.10c [*] Fixed issues with getfenv calls. 1.10.10b [*] More internal changes - it hopefully shouldn't break anything, report if it does. 1.10.10 [*] Updated. [*] Fixed kicks from large amount of HttpGet/HttpPost usage. [!] This update does a lot of internal changes that may break paid/secured scripts - if they do break, please report them to your scripts developer, not us. (as they relied on undocumented/internal features) [*] Added back name field to debug.getinfo (allows you to get local function names for both SX and non-SX functions) [*] Added local function name to SX stack traces. 1.10.9 [*] Updated. 1.10.8d [*] Fixed issue with old processes being stuck in the background after leaving a game - this should fix random S^X crash boxes long times after you exit. 1.10.8c [*] Fixed the kicking/crashing issues - sorry for the inconvenience. 1.10.8 [*] Updated. 1.10.6d [*] Fixed 'Internal error with whitelist' issue with some users. 1.10.6c [*] Did some server updates - sorry about the downtime! You should be able to use S^X now. 1.10.6 [*] Fixed various bugs/issues with injection and similar. [!] We recommend you restart S^X before using this update. It is not required for this update, but we highly recommend it. 1.10.5 [!] This was supposed to be released yesterday but I did not have the time - sorry! [*] Fixed teleport crashing/random errors on teleports. Report if they still happen in #bug-report. [*] Fixed stuck on scanning issues. [*] Attempted to make injection even faster - please report if it got any faster for you in #general. [*] Fixed firetouchinterest (again...) [*] AutoExecute now is before ReplicatedFirst (again) [*] Enjoy the fixes - more coming soon! 1.10.4b [*] Fixed getloadedmodules. [*] Improved speed at the 'injecting...' phase - say if it got any quicker for you in #general. 1.10.4 [*] Updated. 1.10.3 [*] Updated. 1.10.2d [*] Fixed dumpstring. [!] Fixed potential security issue with AutoLaunch that could of affected you if you used S^X from 1.10.2 (Wednesday) until this update was released last night. We suggest changing your alt if you want to be 100% safe. (since it could potentially lead to bans) Note that AutoAttach and regular injection was not affected by this. 1.10.2 [*] Updated. 1.10.1e [*] Crashes should be fixed now. Report any new ones in #bug-report. Sorry for the inconvenience : / 1.10.1c [*] Fixed internal UI crashing. [-] Removed internal explorer - its unstable and not used very much. Dex works just as well now, so just use that. (b was just bug fixes) 1.10.1 [!] This update does some major changes on our backend that don't allow automated updating to this version. Restart S^X to get this version. - Getting an error if you don't restart S^X is expected. Just restart S^X if you dont want to get it. [*] Fixed error spoofing. [*] Various other minor fixes. 1.10.0 [*] Updated. [!] Sorry for the really long update, guys. This update was quite hard - and I only got it fully working today. Report any issues in #bug-report. 1.9.9e [*] Fixed random crashes with certain scripts. Also, please take the time to fill out the following form - I got a few reports of people being banned in the past few days and I don't want to take any chances. Thank you! [link redacted] 1.9.9d [*] Updated. [!] Sorry about the late update - this update was pretty hard to due to a lot of things changing. Sorry. 1.9.9c [+] Added functions 'syn.protect_gui' and 'syn.unprotect_gui'. See below for usage. The new syn.protect_gui function protects your GUIs from recursive FindFirstChild-style attacks. After you call the function, recursive FFA calls from non-Synapse contexts will skip over your protected instances & all children of such instances. Usage: local GUI = game : GetObjects ( \"whatever\" )[ 1 ] syn . protect_gui ( GUI ) -- Its preferable to call protect_gui before your GUI is parented, but it is not required. GUI . Parent = game : GetService ( \"CoreGui\" ) 1.9.9b [*] Updated. 1.9.9 [+] Added function attributes for namecall/future use - see #beta-releases for details. [*] Fixed compile-time error messages being empty. [*] Released __namecall compatibility to full release - report any issues in #bug-report w/ broken scripts. (make sure to test the attributes first) 1.9.8b internal-changes only, beta release SX v1.9.8 (UI only) [*] Fixed CPU usage issue w/ UI. [*] Fixed crash on exit for some users. 1.9.8 [*] Updated. [!] Sorry about the long update - I had dental work today (not very epic) & didnt have time earlier to complete the update. 1.9.7c [+] Added WebSocket API - see #beta-releases for new documentation. 1.9.6b [*] Fixed <connection>.Function/.State/:Fire crashing with certain events. [!] WARNING: <connection>.Function/.State can return nil now - please check for nil before using it further! 1.9.6 [*] Fixed connections API: getconnections firesignal <connection>.Function <connection>.State <connection>:Enable <connection>:Disable <connection>:Fire [*] Fixed firetouchinterest. also connection:Enable/Disable should be more stable then it was before 1.9.5 [*] Updated. 1.9.4 [*] Fixed teleport instability issues. (finally) [*] Improved HWID spoofer in AutoLaunch. (enable from options) [*] Fixed various odd crashes with very specific scripts. [-] Removed ability to execute before ReplicatedFirst. (for now - i'm working on a better impl that shouldnt be horribly unstable) 1.9.3c [*] (Hopefully) fixed D-03 injection issues. 1.9.3b [*] Fixed HttpGet being broken. (aka some scripts not working) 1.9.3 [*] Updated. [!] I am aware about Windows 7 issues, update should be coming soon to fix that. 1.9.2c [*] Fixed yieldfunction instability problems 1.9.2b [*] Fixed wrong offset w/ teleports 1.9.2 [*] Made attaching process more stable overall. \u200eIMPORTANT: This update requires a SX restart. Do not be alarmed by 'Outdated UI version', this is just to force you to restart SX. Thank you! (for beta users: please restart the UI as I didn't add that functionality to it) \u2800 Note for UI devs: This update also has a required sxlib update. Thank you! 1.9.1b [*] Fixed getcallingscript (now stop complaining wally SMH) 1.9.1 [*] Updated. [*] Fixed getsenv breaking with ModuleScripts. [*] Fixed automated conversion w/ numbers in certain functions (ex: setclipboard) setting invalid values. 1.9.0b [+] Added 'syn.queue_on_teleport' (see info in #beta-releases) [*] Fixed crash when making the internal UI windows too small... lol. 1.9.0 [*] Updated. [+] Some much needed love was done to the internal UI - enjoy the fresh new look to it!","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"Custom%20lua%20functions/Console%20Functions/","text":"Console Print < void > rconsoleprint (< string > message ) Prints message into the console.
